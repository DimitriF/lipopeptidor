=========

Application to help structure determination of lipopeptide.

- Enter your mass in the search field and candidate will appear. 

- If no candidat appears, there is no structure that respect the convention of this table. 

- It does not mean that there is no lipopeptide structure for this mass, or the list of candidate given by this table is extensive.
    
Some convention were made during the creation of the table:

- There is only a limited number of amino acid available (9).

- There is only two ways for the Lipo part to be define: the number of carbone and the link to the peptide: ester or amide.

- The number of carbone in the lipo part is defined as the carbon that do not belong to any amino acid.

- The L/D structure isn't discriminate here.

- The potential ramification in the Lipo part are not taken into account.

- There is no insaturation in the Lipo part.

- There is between 10 and 22 carbone in the Lipo part.
